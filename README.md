## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to perform an analysis on data given by CitiBike in New York and to have an understanding if opening a similar business in Des Moines will be successful or not.

## Results

###

The image below shows information about the customers of CitiBike in New York during August 2019.

From this two pie charts we can tell that:
* Majority of customers (81%) were subscribers and the rest (19%) were random customers
* As per customer's gender, 65% of customers were male, 25% female, and 10% unkown.

###

The Image below shows the location of trip initiation in New York. The bigger and darker the dot represents a larger number of trips started in that area.

* Manhattan is the busiest area in New York.

* Manhattan is significantly frequented compared to the other areas.

###

The bar chart below reflects the number of bike rides per each hour of the day.

![](https://github.com/EnoVaqari/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/AugustPeakHours.png)

* The highest usage of bikes is between 17:00 to 19:00.
* The lowest bike usage is between 02:00 to 05:00, which presents the perfect opportunity for bike maintance from Citibike.

###

The image below reflects the number of times each bike is used.

* Bikes that have are used the most appear on the darker side versus bikes that have not been used as much, which appear on the bright side.
* This information is useful to determine the repair and maintance needs per each bike.

###
Below are two heat maps. First one shows weekly rides hourly, and the second one shows weekly rides hourly per each gender.

* Based on the second heat map, we determined that the majority of customers are male.
* The highest weekday rides are between 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM. The most weekend rides are between 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM.
* The lowest number of rides is on Wednesday between 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM.


###

The first graph below shows the number of trips by their duration. The second graph shows the number of trips by their duration per each gender.

![](https://github.com/EnoVaqari/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/TripDurationByGender.png)

* Both images show that usually rides are shorter than an hour.
* The second graph reflects that the rides are shorter than an hours and the majority of customers are male.

###

Below is a heat map, which shows all trips per weekday, per gender, and per each user type.

* This heat map shows once more that the majority of subscribers are male.

## Summary

In conclusion, CitiBike is highly used in New York. The majority of users are male riders, which use the bikes during morning and evening commute hours.

Suggestions that would be helpful for the analysis:

* Adding tourists bike riding data would be beneficial for the analysis as toursim is significantly different from Des Moines.
* Analyzing other months would allow for a better understanding of trends, usage, weather effects, and assist in us providing precise and useful information to Citibike.
